=========

In the Orto Botanico of Siena there are some laboratories focused on the research on some plant species. For example, they analyze the growth of some species of psammophilous, typical of coastal sand dunes.
It is interesting to evaluate the effect of intraspecific competition in terms of growth, germination and the allocation of nutritional resources.
At a density of seeds corresponds a certain rate of competition. Increasing competition, the biomass of each plant is reduced: an interesting problem is to generate models that estimates the optimal seeding density that maximizes the biomass.


The project has as its goal the collection of some data from the lab:

  * Temperature of the vases and the room
  * Moisture in the vases
  * Images of the vases to estimate the growth of the samples


The data on the growth of the samples is used to estimate the biomass. This data will allow to have a series that describes the rate of growth of the samples.
